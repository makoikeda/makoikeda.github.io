Hi there! I'm currently a senior undergrad at Binghamton University double majoring in math and neuroscience. I love pondering about how our brain lets us feel, think and learn. My curiosity toward intricate workings of the **brain** as well as my passion for **math** rooted in the joy of problem sovling has driven me to pursue the interdiciplinary field, _**computational neuroscience**_. I'm in Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Lab under Dr. [Sung Joo Lim](https://blogs.bu.edu/sungjoo/), working on projects that use brain imaging(EEG) and computational analysis(deep learning techniques) to undercover humans auditory cognitive functions such as auditory working memory and attentional mechanisms.

### Education
double degrees in B.S. Integrative Neuroscience and B.A. Mathematical Sciences at SUNY Binghamton (expected 2025)
