Hi there! I'm a currently senior undergrad at Binghamton University double majoring in math and neuroscience. I love pondering about how our brain lets us feel, think and learn. :brain: My curiosity toward intricate workings of the **brain** as well as my passion for **math** rooted in the joy of problem sovling has driven me to pursue the interdiciplinary field, _computational neuroscience_. I'm in Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Lab under Dr. Sung Joo Lim, working on projects that use brain imaging(EEG) and computational analysis(deep learning techniques) to undercover humans auditory cognitive functions such as auditory working memory and attentional mechanisms.
